# Mainnet 
Proposed consensus mechanism for the EXX Mainnet.

:::tip
We are working to implement a scalable **Proof of Staked Authority** consensus mechanism for EXX mainnet. 
:::

## How Proof of Staked Authority  (PoSA) works


## Staking 
Staking is the process of locking up tokens to support a network while receiving a reward in return at the end of your staking period.

### How Does Proof of Stake Work?
A decentralised network must be secured from Sybil attacks and other threats within the system. For us to do this, we implement Proof of Stake which requires that some resources are laid down in order to have influence on the EXX network. In Proof of Stake, this resources are the funds staked in our native tokens EXX. 

### Staking Parameters 

* minimum self-delegated amount: TBA

* minimium delegate amount: TBA

* Unbonding time: 7 days

* offline Unjail fee: TBA

* offline jail time: 2 day

* offline slashing amount: TBA

* Double-sign slashing amount: TBA

* Cross-chain relay fee: TBA
