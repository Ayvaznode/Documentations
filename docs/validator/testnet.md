How validators confirm transactions on EXX Testnet. 

:::tip
EXX Testnet utilises **Proof of Authority** consensus mechanism to handle validation of transactions. 
:::

### How Proof of Authority works 
In Proof of Authority based networks, transactions and blocks are validated by a few selected and approved accounts known as validators which makes the transaction completed within the shortest time. Validators run software allowing them to put transactions in blocks. 

:::note
The process is automated and does not require validators to be constantly monitoring their computers.

### How to become a validator 
In EXX Testnet, you can become a validator if you are approved via an application process.
