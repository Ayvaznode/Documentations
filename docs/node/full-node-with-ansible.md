# Run a full node with Ansible 

Full Node Deployment on EXX Mainnet using Ansible Playbook.

*Requirements: *
- Ansible should be installed on a machine with a minimum of Python3.x installed.
To install ansible with Python 3.x, use `pip3 install ansible`. This will install Python 3 dependencies as well as ansible.
- If you need more help with Ansible installation, check Ansible Repository.

- Ensure Go is not installed on the machine. It is recommended that you use a fresh machine for this setup.
